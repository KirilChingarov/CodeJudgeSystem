    <h1>Welcome to the most deep learning online school for programming</h1>
    <h2>Together we will go through important material uploaded by our best specialists</h2>
</div>
<pre class="info">    The continuation of this course is between <em>nine</em> and <em>twelve</em> months,
    depending on your time spent per day. We recommend watching and reading the whole
    lectures without interrupting and pausing for exercises. There is time for that too.
    After completing the whole presentation we suggest to solve around <em>ten</em> problems.
    After completing them try to find a different way to solve them. There is always another way.
    That will improve your logic thinking, efficiency and knowledge as well. In certain cases
    not the whole information is given in the lectures for purpose. You should learn to search
    for authentic information in the internet and using different tools. If you still can not
    find a solution, there is nothing to worry about. Our team is always ready to help you.
    Just ask your question <a href="contact.html">here</a> and we will answer until the end of the day.
